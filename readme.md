# SimpleLink
This is a simple, yet elegant, open-source, self-hosting alternative to other paid services like LinkTree. No-Ads. No Bs. Free.
This tool requires no database server, no PHP server, and no other prerequisites. This is coded in pure HTMl, CSS, and JQuery. So if you want to make changes to the source code, you don't have to compile it.

# Setup
Download the source code and place it into the directory on your webserver that you would like it to be accessable from.
Fill out the profile.json file with all of your information and then delete all of your unused links. You can also add custom links from there but they may not be supported. Once you save the file, push the file to your web server and then your done.
